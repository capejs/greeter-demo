# Greeter - A demo app for `capejs-rails` gem

This is the Git repository for _Greeter,_ which is a simple application
created using [Cape.JS](https://github.com/capejs/capejs) and [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails).

combining the Cape.JS as front-end framework with the Rails as back-end framework.
